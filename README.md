# Linked Lists
- A linked list is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
- Under the simplest form, each node is composed of a data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the
sequence; more complex variants add additional links.
- This allows for more efficient insertion or removal of elements from any position in the sequence.
- Linked lists can be used to implement several other common abstract data types such as lists (the abstract data type), stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it is not uncommon to implement other data structures directly without using a list as the basis of implementation.
- The principal element of a linked list over an array is that the list elements can easily be inserted or removed without
